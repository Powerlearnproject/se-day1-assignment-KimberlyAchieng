Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering is the systemic application of engineering tools,methods and principles in the development process of high quality software systems.
Software Engineering can be concidered a cornerstone of the technology industry (the sector of the economy that develops and sells technological products) because of, but not limited to, the following reasons:
.It (Software Engineering) is crucial in the creation of technologies like Artificial Intelligence,Machine Learning and Virtual Reality that drive digital transformation and innovation
.As a discipline, it ensures the creation and maintainance of effecient and reliable systems crucial in the Technology Industry as high quality in a very strong pillar.
.It also plays a very vital role in security enhancement and risk management of the software systems in the industry through the embedding of security measures within them done by software engineers.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

.Development of Assembly Language:
This was invented earlier in the evolution journey to simplify programming compared to machine code where programs were manually configured using switches and punch cards which proved tasking.
.Development of High Level Programming Languages:
After assembly language,languages like fortran upon others were created to enable software engineers to write code in a more human-understood format which reduced errors and increased effeciency.
.Introduction of Structured Programming
After Software Engineering was established as a dicipline following the 'Software Crisis',structured programming was introduced as a shift from unstructured coding to use of clear control structures like loops and conditionals improving maintainability and readability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Collecting and documenting user needs.
Design: Architectural and UI design of software.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software.
Testing: Ensuring quality through rigorous tests.
Deployment: Releasing software for use.
Maintenance: Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and enhancements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Comparison:
They both;
.Deliver high quality software
.Follow a step by step process
.Use testing as a quality assurance step 
.Have the same end goal which is a functional product

Differences:
.Waterfall has a fixed project scope from the start while Agile's project scope evolves throughout the development process
.Waterfall is not flexible and changes are difficult to implement while Agile is flexible and changes are easy to implement
.Waterfall is high risk because issues are more likely to be discovered at the end after testing while Agile is lower risk because due to contant testing throughout issues are likely to be discovered and sorted early.

Examples:
.Waterfall is ideal when developing a flight control system for an airline as the requirements are fixed and it requires extensive upfront planning
.Agile is ideal when developing a new e-commerce platform as it needs to be flexible because of the ever changing market trends and customer feedback needs to be incorporated continuously to increase the user friendliness and effeciency.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes code and implements solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing.
Project Manager: Oversees planning, execution, and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs:example-Visual Studio Code
     importance-It increase developer productivity and enhances code quality 
     through features like syntax highlighting,real-time error detection and 
     debbugging tools.
VCSs:example-Github
    importance-It tracks code changes preventing data loss and makes it easy 
    to collaborate with other software engineers

    
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 .Challenge-Clients changing project requirements frequently
  Solution-If you suspect this could be an issue before hand use a suitable 
  methodology like agile that will make it easier to incorporate changes
 .Challenge-Tight deadlines that may compromise quality
  Solution-On top of implimenting task prioritization ,communicate with the 
  client about increasing the assigned time based on the project and explain 
  why then try to reach a reasonable middle ground that above anything else 
  allows you to deliver the best quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: 
 definition:Tests individual software components.
 importance: Ensures that each unit of code functions correctly before 
             integration.
             
Integration Testing:
 definition:Checks interactions between components.
 importance:Helps uncover incompatibilities between components
 
System Testing:
 definition:Evaluates the entire software system.
 importance:Ensures that the complete system functions correctly under 
            different environments and conditions.
            
Acceptance Testing: 
 definition:Ensures software meets user requirements.
 importance:Confirms that the system meets customer expectations before 
            release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Definition:
Prompt Engineering is the process of designing effective questions or statements to obtain the most relevant responses from AI.
Importance:
.Avoids vague responses – If a question is unclear, the AI might give an 
 inaccurate or confusing answer.
.Enhances accuracy – Clear and specific prompts ensure AI understands 
 exactly what is needed.
.Optimizes AI interaction – Well-crafted prompts improve communication with 
 AI, making it more efficient.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
Give me suggestions of cars to buy.
Improved Prompt:
Suggest what cars I can buy within a price range of Ksh500,000 with low fuel consumption and a low cost of maintainace in terms of spare parts.

Explanation:
Prompt two is more effective because it uses a more focused approach based on what I can afford as opposed to prompt one that is vague and will suggest even the cars that are way above my comfort price range resulting in me wasting time looking through all the suggestions for a viable option.
